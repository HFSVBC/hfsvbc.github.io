Website developed for [Study Abroad Portugal](https://www.studyabroadportugal.pt).
Based on the CodeIgniter framework and a bootstrap based frontend and backend. The
website is divided in two main parts: the visitors area of the website where visitors
can get information about the event, news about studying abroad, an institution search
engine, what institutions will be present on the next edition of the event and registration.
The second half of this website is the institutions area of the website where institutions
can get information about the event, metrics on past events and register for the next event.
The next major iteration of the website will be adding AMP powered webpages to the article pages.
